Invert Screen
=============

Ansible role to install a binary that inverts video output on all monitors.

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with
variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

::

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - { role: invert-screen }
